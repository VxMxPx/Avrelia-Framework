<h2>So, what to do next?</h2>
<p>
    Start editing files in <code>application</code> folder. If you want to change
    configurations see <code>config/main.php</code>.<br /><br />
    The controllers, models and views are all in standard folders with same names.
    Additional to that there's also <code>util</code> folder, for all your costume classes and functions.<br /><br />
    All your public files are stored in <code>public</code> folder, if something doesn't
    show up, then check <code>.htaccess</code> file.<br /><br />

<h2>Need CLI access?</h2>
<p>No problem. Just cd to application folder and run <code>./dot help</code> and follow instructions.</p>
