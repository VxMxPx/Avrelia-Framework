Avrelia Framework
####

Basic concepts
======
Avrelia Framework is an open source framework written in PHP5. The framework is in active development, getting constantly new features.
The core is kept small and tidy with help of `plugs` through which caching, database, mail, validation, etc is achieved. Plugs can be added, removed or replaced - the project doesn't depends on them at all. Note though, that some plugs depends on each other.
The framework has MVC structure and CLI scripts support.
